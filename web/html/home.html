<h1>Medication &amp; Pharmacological Resource Portal 0.1</h1>

<p>
This is a resource service intended to help other developers focus on their own application and not on data extraction and manipulation. The main features of the service are listed below.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Remote Procedure Calls</h2>
<p>
	To make full use of the underlying Prolog entailment engine you can do <a href="http://localhost:3020/rpc">remote procedure calls (RPC)</a> to this server. Through this method you can treat this service as a local source to your Prolog or Javascript program. This enables you to do arbitrarily complex queries.
</p>

<h2>API</h2>
<p>
	The service is available for queries through the <a href="http://localhost:3020/api/">API</a>. These queries return data meant for machine consumption.
</p>

<h2>Explore data store</h2>
<p>
	You can <a href="http://localhost:3020/browse/list_graphs">browse the graphs</a> and use the interactive search form to learn about the ontologies and available resources in the data store.
</p>

<h2>SPARQL</h2>
<p>
	For testing and learning about SPARQL queries you can try one of the three SPARQL endpoints accessible from the menu. Pick your favourite. The "Simple Form" endpoint also handles SeRQL queries.
